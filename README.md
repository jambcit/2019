Created in Global Game Jam 2019 Vancouver


---How the game works?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create or Join the room, the room is max 4.
2. You will start in the sandbox mode
3. play with friends, and if you find some object that you can interact, hold "e" to fill the guage of the object.
4. the game will start after counts finished
5. it will start the special game mode(either Hide, Seek and Tag. OR Nerf gun fight)
6. once the game is finished, come back.

* Hide, Seek, and tag won't be able to start with one person due to the game logic
* There are some exceptional bugs/issues that we have not handled yet due to time
* Hope you can be generous and enjoy with the game :)
